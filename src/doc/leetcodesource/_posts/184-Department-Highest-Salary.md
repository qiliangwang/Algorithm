The `Employee` table holds all employees. Every employee has an Id, a salary, and there is also a column for the department Id.

```
+----+-------+--------+--------------+
| Id | Name  | Salary | DepartmentId |
+----+-------+--------+--------------+
| 1  | Joe   | 70000  | 1            |
| 2  | Henry | 80000  | 2            |
| 3  | Sam   | 60000  | 2            |
| 4  | Max   | 90000  | 1            |
+----+-------+--------+--------------+
```

The `Department` table holds all departments of the company.

```
+----+----------+
| Id | Name     |
+----+----------+
| 1  | IT       |
| 2  | Sales    |
+----+----------+
```

Write a SQL query to find employees who have the highest salary in each of the departments. For the above tables, Max has the highest salary in the IT department and Henry has the highest salary in the Sales department.

```
+------------+----------+--------+
| Department | Employee | Salary |
+------------+----------+--------+
| IT         | Max      | 90000  |
| Sales      | Henry    | 80000  |
+------------+----------+--------+
```

# Solution

```sql
select Department.Name as Department, Employee.Name as Employee, Employee.Salary 
from Employee join Department on Employee.DepartmentId = Department.Id
where (Employee.DepartmentId, Salary) 
        in (select DepartmentId, max(Salary) as Salary 
            from Employee 
            group by DepartmentId
           );
```
